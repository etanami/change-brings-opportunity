              There’s an ancient Chinese curse that seems pretty relevant right
              now …
            </p>
            <p><em>… may you live in interesting times</em>.</p>
            <p>
              While at first that may seem like someone wishing you well, it’s
              intended to be ironic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Living in “uninteresting” times allows for peace and tranquility,
              while “interesting” times bring chaotic change and disruption.
            </p>
            <p>
              And let’s face it, this decade so far has been way more
              interesting than we were expecting in 2020 alone. And we’re not
              even out of the current crisis yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              But things are going to get even more interesting. In fact, the
              remainder of the decade may make this year look quaint.

            <p>
              Hey, Brian Clark here. Thanks for clicking over to check out what
              we’re doing with Copyblogger Pro.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ve talked a lot about what’s coming with technology and how it
              affects digital marketing. And while it’s understandable to be
              anxious about all this impending change, I want you to think in
              terms of opportunity instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Change can be tough. But if you prepare yourself for it with the
              proper mindset and and a set of enhanced skills, you can instead
              focus on the wealth of opportunities that are about to present
              themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, with proper preparation, artificial intelligence
              won’t replace you, it will augment you. Paired with technology and
              strategy, your creativity will shine.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the chance to get in on the ground floor of the shift that
              augmented and virtual reality will soon bring to digital marketing
              and online education is reason enough to be optimistic — despite
              the disruptive nature of the years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              What we’re doing with this new membership community is something
              I’ve wanted to do for a couple of years. But the acquisition of
              StudioPress and Rainmaker put everything on hold … until now.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hate to say it, but the timing in 2020 is on point. The changes
              that were coming anyway are accelerating, even as the pandemic has
              upended our lives and led to faster “virtualization” than was
              expected.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s hard not to feel down about the situation we’re in. I worry
              for my parents in Houston, and I’m concerned for everyone who has
              been adversely affected by the events of this year.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m guessing you’re worried and concerned, too. But we have to do
              what we can to adapt, and that’s why we’re going forward with
              Copyblogger Pro starting right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can’t wait for the return to normal (whatever that even means).
              Constant change is the new normal, and we think that we can help
              you get a handle on things so that you not only survive, but
              <i>thrive</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              More importantly, we think that all of us together can figure
              things out better than any of us alone. Community matters as much
              as continuing education, and we could all use meaningful
              connections with others who are on a common path.

                  Again, I see the coming years as a wave of constant
                  opportunity. And I want you to benefit from those
                  opportunities, rather than desperately cling to a past that no
                  longer exists.

                  being mindful about pricing during these uncertain times.

              sophisticated ideas and solutions that set you apart from everyone
              else, but you need foundational knowledge first.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s why we’re including four high-impact masterclasses from
              this year to get you up to speed. If you’re already proficient in
              these areas, you’ll still have these resources for reference.

            <p>
              Online business, email marketing, search engine optimization, and

                  In this 5-day recorded workshop, Tim Stoddart explains the

                  on your particular skills. It’s a process that countless
                  successful entrepreneurs have used to grow and expand their
                  own thriving and profitable online businesses, without the
                  snake oil and empty promises that are all too common.

                  marketing” without having any idea how the content that’s
                  created will lead to sales and market growth. It’s “content

                  audience, and honing your communication with them. And more
                  than content, it’s about leadership and putting the success of

                  creation, a smarter approach to SEO is to be deliberate and

              <strong>Your Low Investment</strong>
            </h1>
            <p>
              Once you experience Copyblogger Pro, you’ll understand that you’re
              receiving training that no $2,000 online course or $5,000
              interactive workshop could give you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each month you spend in this community of learning will build on
              the last, leading you forward with actionable tasks each step of
              the way. This is not passive education, but instead purposefully
              designed instruction for dynamic doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              And yet, your investment is nowhere near $5,000. Or even $2,000
              for that matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              You get an entire year inside Copyblogger Pro for only $495. Each
              month of your membership will build on the last, and in 12 months
              you’ll have transformed your skill set, your business, and your
              life.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the level of education, coaching, networking, and opportunity
              we’re offering, either option is a steal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember, you’re getting instant access to $600 in education and
              assets that we normally sell individually. And that’s before we
              even get started with the monthly advanced sessions that will take
              your skills — and your life — to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’d love for you to join us and explore the vast amount of
              opportunity that comes with accelerating change. To see your
              business and career thrive while others fret over what seems like
              nothing but chaotic change.
            </p>
            <p>
              And just in case you’re concerned about money in these uncertain
              times, you can get started <i>risk free</i>.

            </h1>
            <p>
              Even with affordable pricing, I want this to be a risk-free

            <p>
              That means you’ll get instant access to a huge amount of
              foundational and advanced education — all without a firm
              commitment. You’ll also get to check out the community and
              networking that may even deliver more ROI than the valuable
              training … all thanks to your membership in Copyblogger Pro.
