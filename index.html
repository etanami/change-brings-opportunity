              There’s an ancient Chinese curse that seems pretty relevant right
              now …
            </p>
            <p><em>… may you live in interesting times</em>.</p>
            <p>
              While at first that may seem like someone wishing you well, it’s
              intended to be ironic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Living in “uninteresting” times allows for peace and tranquility,
              while “interesting” times bring chaotic change and disruption.
            </p>
            <p>
              And let’s face it, this decade so far has been way more
              interesting than we were expecting in 2020 alone. And we’re not
              even out of the current crisis yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              But things are going to get even more interesting. In fact, the
              remainder of the decade may make this year look quaint.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hey, Brian Clark here. Thanks for clicking over to check out what
              we’re doing with Copyblogger Pro.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ve talked a lot about what’s coming with technology and how it
              affects digital marketing. And while it’s understandable to be
              anxious about all this impending change, I want you to think in
              terms of opportunity instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Change can be tough. But if you prepare yourself for it with the
              proper mindset and and a set of enhanced skills, you can instead
              focus on the wealth of opportunities that are about to present
              themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, with proper preparation, artificial intelligence
              won’t replace you, it will augment you. Paired with technology and
              strategy, your creativity will shine.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the chance to get in on the ground floor of the shift that
              augmented and virtual reality will soon bring to digital marketing
              and online education is reason enough to be optimistic — despite
              the disruptive nature of the years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              What we’re doing with this new membership community is something
              I’ve wanted to do for a couple of years. But the acquisition of
              StudioPress and Rainmaker put everything on hold … until now.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hate to say it, but the timing in 2020 is on point. The changes
              that were coming anyway are accelerating, even as the pandemic has
              upended our lives and led to faster “virtualization” than was
              expected.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s hard not to feel down about the situation we’re in. I worry
              for my parents in Houston, and I’m concerned for everyone who has
              been adversely affected by the events of this year.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m guessing you’re worried and concerned, too. But we have to do
              what we can to adapt, and that’s why we’re going forward with
              Copyblogger Pro starting right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can’t wait for the return to normal (whatever that even means).
              Constant change is the new normal, and we think that we can help
              you get a handle on things so that you not only survive, but
              <i>thrive</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              More importantly, we think that all of us together can figure
              things out better than any of us alone. Community matters as much
              as continuing education, and we could all use meaningful
              connections with others who are on a common path.
            </p>

                  Again, I see the coming years as a wave of constant
                  opportunity. And I want you to benefit from those
                  opportunities, rather than desperately cling to a past that no
                  longer exists.
                </p>

                  So, let me tell you a bit about what we’re offering with
                  Copyblogger Pro. Because we’re amplifying the value while
                  being mindful about pricing during these uncertain times.
